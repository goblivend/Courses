# TELE
Mini Arduino project using Ackermann model to control a blind car

## Path

Quite easy :
 - ~70 degrees anti clockwise
 - ~70 degrees clockwise

## Work

Take radius of wheels according to servomoter [70, 110]

Then since path is quite easy get main with :
 - Batteries Voltage : XX (adjust travel speed => time to take the path)
 - XX degrees at radius YY
 - XX degrees at radius YY

Take crawler's code as example (EROBI)
